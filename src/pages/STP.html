    <h1>Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)</h1>

    <p>
        The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that ensures a loop-free topology for Ethernet networks. It is crucial for preventing broadcast storms and other issues caused by loops in network topologies.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of STP</h2>

    <p>
        The primary purpose of STP is to eliminate loops in the network that can lead to broadcast storms and degrade network performance. By identifying redundant paths and blocking some of them, STP creates a loop-free logical topology while still providing alternative paths for redundancy in case of link failures.
    </p>

    <h2>How STP Works</h2>

    <p>
        STP operates by selecting a single, designated bridge (switch) as the root bridge for the network. Each bridge in the network determines its distance to the root bridge based on a metric called the Bridge ID. The bridge with the lowest Bridge ID becomes the root bridge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the root bridge is elected, each non-root bridge determines the shortest path to the root bridge and blocks redundant ports to eliminate loops. STP uses a process called Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU) exchange to communicate and share information about the network topology among bridges.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Key features of Spanning Tree Protocol:
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Loop Prevention:</strong> STP identifies and blocks redundant paths in the network, preventing loops from
            forming.</li>
        <li><strong>Root Bridge Election:</strong> STP elects a root bridge that becomes the reference point for the entire
            network. All paths lead back to the root bridge.</li>
        <li><strong>Port States:</strong> STP manages the state of ports in the network, including blocking, listening,
            learning, and forwarding states.</li>
        <li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> If a link or switch fails, STP reconverges to find an alternate path, ensuring
            network continuity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>STP Variants</h2>
    
    <p>
        There are several variants of STP, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>STP (802.1D):</strong> The original version of STP defined by the IEEE 802.1D standard.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid STP (RSTP or 802.1w):</strong> An enhancement to STP that provides faster convergence and improved recovery from network topology changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple STP (MSTP or 802.1s):</strong> Allows for multiple spanning trees within a network, providing flexibility and load balancing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Understanding STP is essential for network administrators to design stable and reliable Ethernet networks with redundant links while avoiding the problems associated with loops.
