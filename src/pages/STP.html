<h1>Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)</h1>

<p>
    The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that ensures a loop-free topology for Ethernet networks.
    Ethernet switches use STP to prevent loops in the network, which could lead to broadcast storms and degraded network
    performance.
</p>

<p>
    Key features of Spanning Tree Protocol:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Loop Prevention:</strong> STP identifies and blocks redundant paths in the network, preventing loops from
        forming.</li>
    <li><strong>Root Bridge Election:</strong> STP elects a root bridge that becomes the reference point for the entire
        network. All paths lead back to the root bridge.</li>
    <li><strong>Port States:</strong> STP manages the state of ports in the network, including blocking, listening,
        learning, and forwarding states.</li>
    <li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> If a link or switch fails, STP reconverges to find an alternate path, ensuring
        network continuity.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The process involves exchanging Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU) between switches to determine the topology and
    establish the most efficient paths. STP uses a tree-like structure, with the root bridge at the top and branches
    leading to other switches.
</p>

<p>
    STP operates in the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and is essential for building reliable and resilient
    Ethernet networks.
</p>

<p>
    Implementing and configuring STP correctly is crucial for maintaining a stable and efficient network infrastructure.
    Network administrators should understand the STP process, port roles, and how to interpret STP information for
    troubleshooting.
