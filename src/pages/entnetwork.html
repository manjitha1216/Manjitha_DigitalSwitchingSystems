    <h1>Enterprise Network </h1>

    <h2>Campus Network Overview</h2>
    <p>An enterprise network is a complex infrastructure that connects various components within an organization. A key element of this network is the campus network, which encompasses multiple local area networks (LANs) situated in one or more buildings within a defined geographic area.</p>
    
    <p>The campus network is typically owned and managed by the organization. It includes both wired Ethernet LANs, operating at high speeds, and shared wireless LANs for increased flexibility in connectivity.</p>

    <h2>How does enterprise networking work?</h2>
    <p>An enterprise network is the organization's backbone. It enables users and systems to connect easily via different connectivity modes such as LAN or cloud. However, this requires advanced and efficient switching and routing devices to transfer business-critical data between servers, applications, desktops, and more.</p>

    <h2>What are the components of an enterprise network?</h2>
    <p>1. Routers</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connects different networks</li>
        <li>Makes routing decisions based on IP addresses</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2. Switches</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connects devices within the same LAN</li>
        <li>Reduces network congestion by forwarding data to specific devices</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. Firewalls</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Controls and monitors network traffic</li>
        <li>Protects against unauthorized access and cyber threats</li>
    </ul>

    <p>4. Servers</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides services such as file storage, email, and web hosting</li>
    </ul>

    <p>5. Gateways</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Facilitates communication between different types of networks</li>
        <li>Acts as a translator to ensure seamless data exchange</li>
    </ul>

    <p>6. Access Points (APs)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Used in wireless networks to connect wireless devices to the infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>7. LAN (Local Area Network)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Internal network connecting devices within a specific location</li>
    </ul>

    <p>8. WAN (Wide Area Network)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connects LANs over a larger geographic area</li>
        <li>Uses routers and communication services for remote locations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>9. VLANs (Virtual LANs)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Logical network segments within a physical LAN</li>
        <li>Allows for better network management and security</li>
    </ul>

    <p>10. Network Security Devices</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Intrusion detection/prevention systems, antivirus gateways, and security appliances</li>
        <li>Safeguards the network from cyber threats</li>
    </ul>

    <p>11. Load Balancers</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers</li>
        <li>Ensures efficient resource utilization and prevents server overload</li>
    </ul>

    <p>12. Network Management Systems</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Software and tools for monitoring, managing, and optimizing network performance</li>
        <li>Includes fault detection, configuration management, and performance analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>
    <h2>Key Considerations in Enterprise Network Design</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Traffic Flow:</strong> Understanding traffic patterns is crucial in designing an effective campus network. This involves studying, predicting, or analyzing network traffic to optimize its movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Hierarchical Design:</strong> A recommended approach is a hierarchical design with three layers: access, distribution, and core. This design enhances scalability, traffic flow, and overall manageability.</li>
        <li><strong>Collision and Broadcast Domains:</strong> In a switched network, collision domains are per switch port, while broadcast domains are per VLAN. VLANs are used to logically segment the network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Addressing Questions on Network Design</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>End-user PCs:</strong> End-user PCs are typically connected to the access layer, providing connectivity to individual devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution Layer Devices:</strong> Devices in the distribution layer typically operate at Layer 3 (Network layer), handling routing and filtering functions.</li>
        <li><strong>Core Layer:</strong> The core layer aggregates high-speed links to ensure efficient data transport across the network.</li>
    </ul>
