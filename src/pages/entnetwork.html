    <h1>Enterprise Network Explanation</h1>

    <h2>Campus Network Overview</h2>
    <p>An enterprise network is a complex infrastructure that connects various components within an organization. A key element of this network is the campus network, which encompasses multiple local area networks (LANs) situated in one or more buildings within a defined geographic area.</p>
    
    <p>The campus network is typically owned and managed by the organization. It includes both wired Ethernet LANs, operating at high speeds, and shared wireless LANs for increased flexibility in connectivity.</p>

    <h2>Key Considerations in Enterprise Network Design</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Traffic Flow:</strong> Understanding traffic patterns is crucial in designing an effective campus network. This involves studying, predicting, or analyzing network traffic to optimize its movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Hierarchical Design:</strong> A recommended approach is a hierarchical design with three layers: access, distribution, and core. This design enhances scalability, traffic flow, and overall manageability.</li>
        <li><strong>Collision and Broadcast Domains:</strong> In a switched network, collision domains are per switch port, while broadcast domains are per VLAN. VLANs are used to logically segment the network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Addressing Questions on Network Design</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>End-user PCs:</strong> End-user PCs are typically connected to the access layer, providing connectivity to individual devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution Layer Devices:</strong> Devices in the distribution layer typically operate at Layer 3 (Network layer), handling routing and filtering functions.</li>
        <li><strong>Core Layer:</strong> The core layer aggregates high-speed links to ensure efficient data transport across the network.</li>
    </ul>
