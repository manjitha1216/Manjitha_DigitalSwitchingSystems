    <h1>Multilayer (MLS) switch</h1>

    <li>A multilayer switch is a network device that has the ability to operate at higher layers of the OSI reference model, unlike the Data Link Layer (DLL) traditionally used by switches. A multilayer switch can perform the functions of a switch as well as that of a router at incredibly fast speeds. A switch traditionally inspects frames, while a multilayer switch inspects deeper into the protocol description unit (at packet or even at segment level).</li>
    <h2>Multilayer Switch vs Layer 2 Switch</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Layer 2 switch forwards data packets based on the Layer 2 information like MAC addresses. As a traditional switch, it can inspect frames. While multilayer switches not only can do all the job that Layer 2 switches do, it has routing function as well, including static routing and dynamic routing. So multilayer switches can inspect deeper into the protocol description unit. For more information</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Multilayer Switch vs Router</h2>
    <u1>
        <li>routers typically use software to route. While multilayer switches route packets on ASCI (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) hardware.</li>
        <li>multilayer switches route packets faster than routers.</li>
