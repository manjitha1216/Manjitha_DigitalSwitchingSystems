    <h1>Operation of OSI Second layer (Layer 2)</h1>
    <li>The data link provides for the transfer of data frames between hosts connected to the physical link. Within the semantics of the OSI network architecture, the protocols of the data link layer respond to service requests from the network layer, and perform their function by issuing service requests to the physical layer. That transfer can be reliable or unreliable; many data link protocols do not have acknowledgments of successful frame reception and acceptance, and some data link protocols might not even perform any check for transmission errors. In those cases, higher-level protocols must provide flow control, error checking, acknowledgments, and retransmission. The frame header contains the source and destination addresses that indicate which device originated the frame and which device is expected to receive and process it. In contrast to the hierarchical and routable addresses of the network layer, layer 2 addresses are flat, meaning that no part of the address can be used to identify the logical or physical group to which the address belongs.</li>
    <h2>Services:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Frame Encapsulation -> The Data Link Layer takes the packets of data from the Network Layer (Layer 3) and encapsulates them into frames. These frames include both the data and control information necessary for transmission. The frame structure and format depend on the specific data link protocol being used, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), or PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol). </li>
        <li>Physical addressing -> The layer adds a header to each frame that identifies the MAC addresses of the sender and receiver. MAC addresses are used to uniquely identify devices within the same local network segment.</li>
        <li>Flow control -> The Data Link Layer can also implement flow control to manage the speed at which data is sent between devices. Flow control mechanisms help prevent buffer overflows and data loss due to congestion.</li>
        <li>Error Control -> Data bits can get damaged or corrupted when traveling over a computer network due to difficulties such as network problems and network interferences. Layer 2 recognizes - and sometimes corrects - errors, including single bit errors and multiple-bit errors. Additionally, the data link layer determines where faults in the physical layer may occur.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data link layer protocols</h2>
    <u1>
        <li>Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), which deals with error correction, error recovery, and multipoint link support</li>
        <li>High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC), which supports point-to-point communication</li>
        <li>Serial Line Interface Protocol (SLIP), which handles the transfer of IP packets</li>
        <li>Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), which transports IP packets</li>
    </u1>
