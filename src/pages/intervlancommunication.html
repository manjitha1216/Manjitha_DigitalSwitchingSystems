<h1>Inter VLAN Communication through Layer 3 Routing</h1>

<p>
    Inter VLAN communication is the process of enabling communication between different VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
    within a network. This is achieved through Layer 3 routing, where a Layer 3 device, such as a router or Layer 3 switch,
    facilitates communication between VLANs.
</p>

<p>
    In a network with multiple VLANs, devices within the same VLAN can communicate with each other by default. However, for
    communication between devices in different VLANs, a Layer 3 device is required. This Layer 3 device acts as a gateway,
    routing traffic between VLANs.
</p>

<p>
    The steps involved in enabling Inter VLAN communication through Layer 3 routing include:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Configuration of VLANs on the switch.</li>
    <li>Assigning VLAN interfaces on the Layer 3 device.</li>
    <li>Configuring IP addresses on the VLAN interfaces.</li>
    <li>Enabling routing on the Layer 3 device.</li>
    <li>Setting up routing protocols or static routes for inter VLAN routing.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Once configured, devices in different VLANs can communicate with each other through the Layer 3 device, which acts as
    the interconnecting router.
</p>

<p>
    Inter VLAN communication is essential for dividing a network into logical segments while allowing controlled
    communication between those segments. It enhances network security and performance by providing a way for different
    VLANs to exchange data when necessary.
