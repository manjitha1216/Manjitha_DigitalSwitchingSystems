<h1>Multilayer Switching with Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF)</h1>

<p>
    Multilayer Switching (MLS) with Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) is a technology that enables high-performance
    routing and switching in Cisco switches. It operates at multiple layers of the OSI model, combining the functions
    of Layer 2 and Layer 3 devices.
</p>

<p>
    Key features of Multilayer Switching with CEF:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Efficient Forwarding:</strong> CEF builds and maintains a Forwarding Information Base (FIB), allowing
        the switch to make forwarding decisions based on Layer 3 information in hardware, resulting in faster packet
        forwarding.</li>
    <li><strong>Topology-based Forwarding:</strong> CEF uses a prepopulated database of the entire network topology,
        allowing the switch to forward packets at high rates. The longest match in the database is used to determine the
        correct Layer 3 destination.</li>
    <li><strong>Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF):</strong> CEF is the second generation of Multilayer Switching and
        utilizes specialized hardware to optimize routing information for efficient packet forwarding. It is known for
        its high-speed performance and scalability.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Unlike traditional switches, Multilayer Switches with CEF can perform routing functions at incredibly fast speeds,
    making them suitable for high-performance networks. This technology enhances network efficiency and reduces latency,
    providing a seamless experience for end-users.
</p>

<p>
    Understanding how CEF operates and its integration with Multilayer Switching is essential for network
    administrators to optimize network performance and scalability.
